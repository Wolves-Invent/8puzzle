The only function we have used it is deepcopy() from copy package which it is come with python 
you have not to setup any packages 
we have used python2.7 
the script take a long time to generate a solution because it generate 4 solutions with Hamming, Manhattan, Hamming and Manhattan, and Hamming and Manhattan with another method in ordering
and chossing the possible moves the script print the steps of the solution that have the fewest number of steps and print the number of steps of all solutions
